## Service Schedule!

The main function of this app is for a motorcycle service departments to add a customer getting work down on their motorcycle and keep track/alert them on the status of their bike being worked on.

The schedule dashboard will have a color coded service status so that service writers can visually see which customers they need to contact about their status.

## Inspiration

I have a passion for both motorcycles, photography and coding. This product is one that I see being very useful for dealerships that want to offer a seemless repair/service experience for their customers.
